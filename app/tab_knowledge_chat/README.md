### Interaction mode: Knowledge Chat

This interaction mode loads all knowledge bases from the team's `knowledge` directory, and offers the user to ask them questions.

**Benefits:**
- Onboarding: This could enable faster discovery of knowledge for people who are new on the team.
- Fixing errors or incidents: This could enable faster discovery of information for people who are trying to fix an error in the application.

**Risks and caveats:**
- Data quality: The usefulness depends on the quality of the input data for a particular use case. This use case might also require more technical expertise in this space on the team, to further tweak the creation of embeddings to make it work.
- It remains to be seen for each use case if this provides added value to already existing searches (e.g. a wiki search).
