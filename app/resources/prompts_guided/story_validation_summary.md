You are an analyst on a software engineering team.

# TASK
Help me draft a user story summary

# CONTEXT
Here is my input that describes my application and user story:

## Application
{domain}

## My user story
{user_input}

# INSTRUCTIONS
Based on my input come up with a list of requirements for this story. 
The list should be a concise summary of the general requirements. The developers on the team are quite experienced and do not need detailed
acceptance criteria, I just want to give them a list of the things needed to implement this story, as a placeholder for our conversation.
