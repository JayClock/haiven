### Interaction mode: Brainstorming

This interaction mode loads prompts from the `teams/prompts/brainstorming` directory. All prompts in that directory should get the AI to ask the user questions, followed by a final output. The user can then continue the chat session as they see fit.

TODO: For the user, it might not be apparent why there are two tabs for "Chat" and "Brainstorming", it just needs to be different types of prompts. Maybe in the future, those two interaction modes should be merged?
