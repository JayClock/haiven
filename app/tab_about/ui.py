            **Team AI is an accelerator to help software delivery teams build their own lightweight prompting application as an *assistant and knowledge amplifier for frequently done tasks* across their software delivery process.**
                    
            This demo shows some examples of the types of tasks that can be supported by GenAI, and the types of interaction patterns teams can leverage.

            ### Benefits
            - Amplifying and scaling good prompt engineering via reusable prompts
            - Use GenAI optimized for a particular team's or organization's tasks, wherever existing products are too rigid
            - Knowledge exchange via the prepared context parts of the prompts
            - Helping people with tasks they have never done before (e.g. if team members have little experience with story-writing)
            - The "Q&A" pattern in particular helps leverage LLMs for brainstorming and finding gaps earlier in the delivery process

            ### How does the "acceleration" work?            
            When a team takes the codebase as a starting point to deploy their own Team AI, they can use existing demo components as a basis for their own task support. E.g., use the "Story writing" example as a basis if you want to support a task with a Question<>Answer interaction. It's not a lot of code, the "Story writing" example is just about 70 lines of Python code, plus the prompting template.
