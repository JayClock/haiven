# When to use which interaction pattern

It depends on what you have available as input, at what level of detail?

## Chat

If you already have a good description of your input, or you want to do something that doesn't need detailed input.

## Brainstorming

If you want to fill in the gaps, i.e. you want the AI to lead you through what input you need to create to get to your goal (it will ask a bunch of questions).

## Diagrams

If you don't have a good description of your input, but you have a picture or diagram that can serve as a starting point, then you can use that as part of your prompt.
